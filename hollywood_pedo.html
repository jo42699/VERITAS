    <h1>PEDOWOOD</h1>
    <br>
    <h2> ISSAC KAPPY</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Kappy made his feature film debut as a hustler in the movie Beerfest (2006). He would go on to act in the movies Not Forgotten, Fanboys, Terminator Salvation, Saint John of Las Vegas (all 2009), Klown Kamp Massacre (2010), Lemonade Mouth, Thor, and 10 Years (all 2011), and the television series Breaking Bad, The Night Shift, and Rachel Dratch's Late Night Snack. As a musician, Kappy played in the band Charles McMansion with Tom Sandoval. The group released one recording, the song "T.I.P." (an acronym for Touch In Public), and appeared on the reality show Vanderpump Rules. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Kappy appeared as a guest on Alex Jones' radio show InfoWars in August 2018, on which he accused multiple movie stars, such as Tom Hanks and Seth Green, of pedophilia as part of the QAnon conspiracy theory, which involves a cabal of child molesters who run a global child sex-trafficking ring. He then started going on social media and making bold allegation about these celebrities, giving details of the disturbing acts and code words these elites use such as pizza, sauce, cheese etc
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Isaac Kappy claimed Tom Hanks, Steven Spielberg, Seth Green, Dan Schneider, Stephen Colbert are Pedophiles. He says the Rothschilds are involved in Cannibalism. “This is a worldwide Pedophile Cult at the highest level in our society that uses Blackmail to control leaders, politicians, law makers, judges, film makers, actors, artists and others.” Sadly Isaac Kappy died by suicide after "forcing himself" off a bridge. He was then hit by a vehicle on Route 66, which Tom Hanks tweeted before his death. Before he died Kappy was able to build up a following called. Isaac’s army on twitter has over 350k followers run by a fan and many more people have an idea of what goes on in the industry. His last moments where lived in fear until his inevitable death.

    <h2> ISSAC KAPPY ALLEGATIONS</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        Kappy made a lot of allegations about these celebrities. at the time of making these allegations celebrities where still seen as perfect can do no harm figures but Kappy certainly made a dent in the public perception of these people. according to him he was told about these Hollywood norms which involved pedophilia, he wasn’t ok with it and didn’t take the information as well as they thought he would. If you remember the elite party segment I did regarding the quote “a slow drip is better than a flood” I’m guessing this is what they where trying to avoid. if regular people found out about these despicable acts they too would freak out. Something that is also very strange is the fact that if you search for the allegations he made you will not find anything. most people who posted his content got their accounts taken down . there is only one platform where you can see his content and that is twitter. its almost like they where trying to get rid of him. He made claims about Tom Hanks and Steven Spielberg being pedophiles, outed people for “Selling their soul”, he claimed Oprah had a trafficking ring. He made so many claims about Hollywood directors and executives being Satanists. he also made more claims about pizzagate which I already covered.He was in the habit of releasing long, rambling videos on the Periscope video streaming platform where he would comment on questions raised in the real-time chat window. He would name people and businesses he alleged were involved in pedophilia, sometimes in a sing-song voice (he was also a musician I believe so maybe not that weird). My impression is that he became regarded as a crusader of the Q movement, a source of new information, and something of a celebrity. But was the information actually new?

        I don't know which of his allegations he claimed to have firsthand knowledge of and which he had picked up from others. From what I can tell he offered little proof of his allegations beyond saying that he would love to be sued so that he can get various conspirators on the witness stand.
        
        Was he just redistributing information he'd gathered through his research? Are the accusations of Hanks, etc., based on circular logic where Kappy learns about allegations from QAnon, says something, and then QAnon uses the fact that Kappy is pointing the finger as further evidence?
        
        Because Kappy says he put so much time into researching Pizzagate once he learned about it, it seems to me that he did not start out with firsthand knowledge of it. I hypothesize that, like myself, he was basically an activist, analyst, and commentator who helped disseminate new information from other sources and identify new connections in existing information.
        
        For now, for me, his rambling accusations lend very little additional support to existing evidence. That doesn't mean the accusations are unfounded and in any case I very much appreciate what he did with his time and energy. Others did not appreciate his promotion of this material, however. 
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> HIS DEATH</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        There is a video of his alleged suicide but Some people have said that Kappy looks like he was digitally inserted into the video. The poster of the video feels confident it's authentic. Take a look. I've studied it myself and my opinion is: hella fake.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p> Here are some still frames:</p>
    <br>
    <img style="height: 30  0px;" src="../IMAGES3/Kappy1.jpeg" alt="">
    <br>
    <p>
        And a still frame of a different section of the overpass railing by itself: 
    </p>
    <br>
    <img style="height: 300px;" src="../IMAGES3/kappy2.png" alt="">
    <br>
    <p>
        My arguments:
        <br>
      <br>The metal bar and cement of the railing seem to be straight vertical. I don't think the cement is "in   front" of the railing.
      <br>
      <br>Kappy's shins are shown as being straight parallel to and very close to the cement of the railing. His thighs are at a 45º angle and he is definitely "seated" back on the top of the railing. That spacing and that seating arrangement don't seem possible.
      <br>
      <br>There is a bright strip between his leg and his leg shadow in Frame 3, no gap in Frame 4, and no leg shadow at all in Frame 5.
      <br>
     <br>Frames 5 and 6 have a few stray pixels to the left of his body from the camera's perspective. I originally thought the large white spot to the left of his leg in Frame 6 was evidence of doctoring, but then I realized it is a white marker on the bridge railing which you can see in a few other places.
     <br>
     <br>The newspaper report says that two teens (and I saw somewhere else that they were young men rather than teens) came forward and said they stopped and tried to physically restrain him from jumping but he "forced himself off".

    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h2> MY THOUGHTS</h2>
    
    <p>
        1.	Who tries to physically restrain a stranger from jumping? From everything I've ever seen (in movies, granted), you try to talk people off the ledge instead of approaching and grabbing them.
        <br>
        <br>
     2.	Suppose that the two men actually forced Kappy off the overpass. Suppose that they threw him right in front of a pickup truck so that he would be instantly struck for sure. They would have to know that there's a good chance that they would be noticed, and so what better way to avert suspicion than to wait for the cops and claim that no, they didn't throw him off, they were just trying to physically restrain him from forcing himself off? If there's any lingering doubt then hey, here's a dashcam video of Kappy sitting on the ledge by himself.
     <br>
     <br>
     3.	If the dashcam video is fake - and it looks like it is to me - it could easily have been pre-recorded with an advance date or reclaimed after the fact "for review" and then edited before release.
     <br>
     <br>
     4.	Is it a bit weird to come forth with dashcam footage of a guy sitting on the ledge? Best case the truck driver remembers the guy sitting there after hearing about the incident. Even then: is it a bit weird for that footage to be released to the public?
     <br>
     <br>
     5.	If I were able to investigate this I would want to know more about the two men, where they live, and what they were doing that day. I would want to know more about who drove that military truck, who retrieved the dashcam footage, and who gave that footage to the police.
     <br>
     <br>
     6.	Isaac Kappy lived in Albuquerque at the time. What was he doing way out in Arizona, about a 4-hour drive away? Was his car there somewhere? How did he get out to the overpass? This article says the official version is that he was on a trip from LA to Albuquerque, got a flat tire in Tucson, parked at a hotel there, and ... jumped off an overpass 260 miles away. An overpass that's not even on the direct route between Tucson and Albuquerque. For that matter, Tucson itself isn't even on the route from LA to Albuquerque.
     <br>
     <br>
     7.	This happened around 7:30am. Suicide rates are much higher at night and very low in the morning. Only 12.78% of all suicides happen between 6am and 12pm. For pretty obvious reasons: you wake up, you feel refreshed, and it usually least takes a while at least for the cares of the world to start weighing on your mind.
     <br>
     <br>
     8.	Isaac Kappy obviously had a conscience. It radiates through all his actions and videos including his "farewell" video. And yet he supposedly chose to kill himself by throwing himself off an overpass in front of a pickup? That kind of suicide could easily harm or kill the driver of the pickup and any passengers. I don't believe Kappy would suicide in a way that would endanger another life.
     <br>
     <br>
     9.	If he was murdered I think it's likely he was killed before he was thrown off the bridge, knowing that the impact would erase the evidence.

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        Along with other allegations, one of the weird things about Tom Hanks is his love of posting photos of solitary gloves or shoes on Instagram with a little story about hoping the person who lost them is okay.
        That doesn't seem too bad, but check this out. About a month before Kappy's assisted suicide, Hanks posted this:
    </p>
    <br>
    <img style="height: 300px;" src="../IMAGES3/ISSAC2.jpg" alt="">
    <p>Tom Hanks posted this picture and labeld it "infamous Route 66 roadkill" </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
   <p>
    Kappy was, in a horrible way of speaking, "road kill on Route 66". Coincidence? Possibly. Tom Hanks seem to have an obsession with gloves and posts them to his instagram But now check out some of Tom's photos:

   <br>
   <p>SRC USA????   </p>
   <br>
   <p> What does that mean? </p>
   <br>
   <p>All the picturs he posted didn’t have any letters, but why does this one have? </p>
   <br>
   <p> So I decided to search in on Google</p>
   <br>
   <img style="height: 400px;" src="../IMAGES3/screenshot(1).jpg" alt="">
   <br>
   <p> Nothing to see here</p>

   <p> It still shows normal things</p>
   <br>
   <p> I searched "RCS USA"</p>

  <p> At this point I'm weirded out and I leave after seeing more disturbing stuff.</p>
  <br>
  <p> Keep in mind this all started with the picture TOM HANKS posted. </p>
  <br>
  <p>The fact that Hanks took a picture with SRC  USA in it, and that code is linked to predators, and Hanks has been accused of being a predator... Just a coincidence huh? </p>

  <h3> SARAH RUTH ASHCRAFT</h3>
  <br>
  <p>
    Sarah Ruth Ashcroft says that in 1994 or 1995 her father sold her to Tom Hanks for sex. She was 13 years old. There are many cases of both real and fabricated rape and abuse accusations and so in my view this allegation is nothing definitive. But it is the first of several things to poke holes in the wholesome image of Tom Hanks.

    If you’re not aware of PIZZAGATE scandals, it’s basically from a series of leaked emails where politicians where using pizza related code words I their emails. They where using pizza related terms out of context

  <p>An example of the emails</p>
  <br>

    "I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them."
    <br>"Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.
    <br>I miss you both

     ("Give notice when changing strategies" when talking about expecting pasta and getting cheese as a gift? Who talks like that? Who gives "pasta and wonderful sauces" as a gift? Playing dominos on cheese versus on pasta?!). Nobody talks like this. 
     <br>These code words where linked to a pedophile ring shut down by the FBI. I did a whole segment on it.

  <h1> PIZZA IN HOLLYWOOD</h1>
  <br>
  <p>
    I personally don’t like pizza, I think its overrated. Its no secret that Celebrities ALL seem to love pizza, so much so that they have “pizza parties”. They are always taking about pizza and cheese in weird ways. If you’re not familiar with my work on pizza gate I suggest going through it. I’ve been saying it for a while they are all in a big club and in this segment, I’m going to go through some of my top ten favorite times celebrities were talking about “PIZZA” and “PIZZA PARTIES”. 
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2>1) OBAMA AND KAMALA </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    In this 2020 interview between Kamala Harris and Barack Obama things seem to be going normal until they both start talking about how much joe Biden loves ice cream. There’s nothing wrong talking about Ice cream but it was Obama response that got me off guard, he spoke very weird. In this interview when Kamala Harris said “So tell me about Joe and what is your relationship with Joe and what do I need to know. What is the thing about ice cream, he loves ice cream.”  he makes a very weird response he said “Ice cream is big umm pasta with red sauce he can he can go deep on that uhh.” Then he starts taking about glasses. Nobody talks like this, why did he answer the question so weirdly and why is he talking about pasta and red sauce when asked about ice cream. Hmm very strange.
  </p>
  <br>
  <img src="../IMAGES3/PIZZA1.jpg" alt="">
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <br>
  <h2> 2) KEVIN HEART </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    Our beloved comedian, in one of his performances it was going pretty normal. He tells a story about how he went for a party, then he said the host started addressing everyone and telling everyone that he’s about to bring out the pizza, why don’t I just quote him.  <br>
    "I went to Seinfeld's house for a good party. Some of the best food I've ever had it was ******* amazing man. At the end of the dinner party Seinfeld came walking out he's like nobody go anywhere you guys are in for a treat tonight we're gonna have some "brick oven pizza" everybody went crazy in the party what Oh my God we're getting PIZZA. One lady was like how many CHESSES Jerry, he was like "there's like 7 different cheeses, 7 different cheeses" people went crazy, by the way all these people were white these all ******* white people, they start chanting bop bop bop bop bop the **** is pop man, what the **** is Bop. White lady lean on the table she's like it's short for brick oven pizza, ohh **** ohh **** oh OK I get it. Seinfeld has Italian men walk out there with like pizza garb on and start passing out the pizza saying Italian ****.  "Jum jumma jumm jum" I don't know Italian, what I'm doing is racist right now I apologize. people were eating the ******* pizza going crazy Oh my God I taste the CHESES Jerry I taste the CHEESES they bought my piece of pizza I took a bite I couldn't ******* believe it best pizza I've ever had in my life.  I've never tasted this ****,White BABIES have some type of lettuce on it." 
    <br>He accidentally said white babies while talking about pizza then tried to play it off. Wait a second who the hell has pizza for dessert and why is the cheese separate from the pizza. Why are they so excited for pizza, why did that person ask how many different cheeses and why are they going crazy over cheese. Hmm they sure do like pizza.

  <h2> 3) HILARY CLINTON  </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    I’ve already covered some of the allegations on her but in this interview where she is talking About pizza she might have slipped up. She was taking about a party at the white house that Barak Obama had. A pizza party, Hmmmm  a pizza party at the white house. Obama did throw a party at the white house and there was a leaked email between her and Obama during the 2016 pizzagate scandal but let me quote her lovely party story. <br> "So they were always trying to call for pizzas and you can't order "a pizza" to the White House, so I'll just tell you that we did, sometimes there were exceptions. You can go out maybe and one of the KIDS could go out maybe and meet the, yeah but the first time you would have thought that you know war had been declared there's all paid off truck "pizza was ordered what do we do with it" yeah it it we have lots of challenges like that."  <br>When she said kids she realized she made a mistake and she kept saying “a pizza”. Why are trucks being used to deliver a pizza. That verifies the email between her and Obama because in that email they where talking about how it was risky to bring pizza to the white house. I don’t think it’s that hard to bring pizza to the white house unless we aren’t talking about pizza.

  <p>
      "Dear Barack
      <br>When we began the pizza arrangement, I thought we were going to be more careful than this, operating from the White House is not what I originally had in mind. Remember that the hot dogs can come but if you make a spectacle out of it this will be our downfall.
      Please know that I’m speaking as a friend. You are the president and can do as you like but I have to say, I think it will be wiser to restrict this activity to our predetermined locations.
      Let me know what everyone thinks. We can vote on it if you like.

    The whole Chrissy Teigen shitstorm apparently erupted after journalist Chrissy Mayr, via some Twitter-account-tracking software, noticed that Teigen had just deleted 30,000 old tweets. Mayr tweeted a question about it and Teigen responded that "I actually deleted 60,000 tweets yesterday" [emphasis mine].

  <p>What kind of stuff was she deleting? Nothing much, just like: </p>

  <h2>5) ADAM SANDLER </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    This one hurts ngl, I’ve been watching him since I was a kid but he seems to love pizza parties. About 11 years ago during the Oscars during his speech he invited everyone to a Jennifer Anniston pizza parties. Hmmm very suspicious if you ask me. He is also really close to Jennifer and seems to be a big part of these PIZZA parties.

  <h2> 7) HELEN IN THE OSCAR</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    In the 2014 Oscars Helen was talking about an Oscar pizza party and made a lot of jokes about pizza then she started talking about a pizza party after the Oscars. She then proceeded to bring in boxes of pizza and passed it around giving everyone a slice. They were all looking so happy, was this some kind of sick joke. It’s also worth mentioning that Helen has been spotted wearing the FRAZZLEDRIP symbol and has weird paintings in her house depicting weird “demonic” imagery

  <h2> 8) JENNIFER ANISTON</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    Another beloved actress who is a fanatic for PIZZA, so yummy in my tummy pizza. Here she is talking to Anne Hathaway about how well the know each other and how Anne has been to a number of her pizza parties. Wow Anne really seems to love pizza which is surprising because I never expected her to be part of this. They both laugh about it and carry on with the conversation.

  <h2> 9) JENNIFER ANNISTON AND ADAM SANDLER</h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    In this interview, Jenifer and Adam are talking about how much they love pizza parties and how Jennifer makes the best pizza. Adam went on and on about how Jennifer is such a good party host. They started talking about all the different type of pizza they make and other random stuff. See how all these celebrities are in on this very weird joke, I wonder why they choose pizza to represent their weirdness

  <h2> 10) THE ROCK AND TOM HANKS </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    While hosting SNL the Rock and tom hanks seem to be kicking it off then the rock said “One thing everyone can agree on is PIZZA and US.” knowing what we know now that joke isn’t so innocent anymore especially now that we know of the Monster that is TOM HANKS. These pizza terms seem to be popular in Hollywood. If you’re wondering what goes on during these parties I suggest reading the segment I did on elite parties.

  <h2>CONCLUSION  </h2>
  <br>
  <p>
    WHAT DO I THINK? I think that they are all in on it. I believe this is an open secret in Hollywood. A lot of stories have come out about Hollywood having a pedophilia problem but I think this is more than just pedophilia. I believe the initiation that brings you into Hollywood or as people know “selling your soul” is more than just signing a “devil/demon” contract, I believe it is probably a blackmail thing that most likely involves you committing these acts then it gets recorded forever binding you to the group. I also believe this works on a blackmail system. Depending on how you viewed the website this is most likely going to be the final segment. Thank you for reading along and don’t forget to always seek truth. VERITAS.
