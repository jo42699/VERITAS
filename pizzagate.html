        <h2>WHAT IS PIZZAGATE</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            "Pizzagate" refers to a conspiracy theory that emerged during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. It alleged that there is a child trafficking ring involving high-profile Democratic Party members, including Hillary Clinton and was being run out of the basement of a Washington D.C. pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong. This theory gained traction through social media and various internet forums, fueled by hacked emails from Clinton's campaign chair, John Podesta, that were leaked by Russian hackers on WikiLeaks.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            At first glance these accusations seem bizarre, insane or even borderline crazy but the closer you look at it the less crazy it seems. This is a deep rabbit hole people dare not to even go through and in all honesty I don’t blame them. These accusations didn’t just appear from thin air, so where did it come from? In the year 2016 a Russian hacker group hacked the email of Hilary Clinton, John Podesta and some other members of the democratic party. In these emails they kept talking about pizza out of context in a weird way almost like it was code for something.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There where leaked emails between John Podesta, Marina Abramovic, Hilary Clinton and ex president Obama and in these emails they kept taking about pizza and pizza parties keep in mind these emails are real and were addressed as innocent private discourse. Now where did the pedophilia allegations come from, there was a pedophile ring related to a pizzeria called Comet Ping Pong. Their websites got hacked and they had listings of pizza for $65,000 and other crazy prices and these where apparently a cover for human trafficking. It was discovered by 2007 official FBI documents that pedophiles have code words and symbols among themselves which they use to recognize their preferences e.g hotdog, pizza, etc.

            "Dear Barack
            <br>When we began the pizza arrangement, I thought we were going to be more careful than this, operating from the White House is not what I originally had in mind. Remember that the hot dogs can come but if you make a spectacle out of it this will be our downfall.
            Please know that I’m speaking as a friend. You are the president and can do as you like but I have to say, I think it will be wiser to restrict this activity to our predetermined locations.
            Let me know what everyone thinks. We can vote on it if you like.

            I think you should give notice when changing strategies which have been long in place. I immediately realized something was different by the shape of the box and I contemplated who would be sending me something in the square shaped box. Lo and behold, instead of pasta and wonderful sauces, it was a lovely, tempting assortment of cheeses, Yummy. I am awaiting the return of my children and grandchildren from their holiday travels so that we can demolish them. Thank you so much. I hope you and your gang are well.
            <br>I miss you both
             <br>Best wishes fro a merry Christmas and Happy New Year.
             <br>Ps. Do you think I'll do better playing dominos on cheese than on pasta?
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            "Give notice when changing strategies" when talking about expecting pasta and getting cheese as a gift? Who talks like that? Who gives "pasta and wonderful sauces" as a gift? Playing dominos on cheese versus on pasta?!

             To recap this:
             <br>
            A realtor finds a handkerchief and asks if Susan and Herb want it. That's all she says. Nothing about maps, nothing about pizza.
            Susan emails John and asks if the handkerchief is his. She doesn't seem sure about that, but she does seem pretty sure that it's got a "pizza-related map" on it.
             John says that it's "not worth worrying about".
             <br>
            This email thread doesn't make sense when read at face value. There's gotta be something else going on there.

            Comet Ping Pong (often abbreviated as Comet) is a pizzeria, restaurant, and concert venue located on Connecticut Avenue in Washington, D.C.'s Chevy Chase neighborhood. On November 25, 2016, a hacker named SPduhGhost reveled that Comet Pizza had a hidden app with 100+ verified users that distribute encrypted child pornography among each other as well as make massively large purchases on items like “Pizza Torture Special?” and listings of pizza for $65,000.

        <h2>THE RED SHOES </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            There have been rumors of red shoes used as a mode of identification between high ranking elite pedophiles. According Macaulay Culkin (an American actor most popular for his role in Home alone) he went on a radio show in France and made some crazy allegations, the explosive claims made by Culkin were reported by French media including Les Enchos, a newspaper, however all reports were quickly taken down within an hour of appearing online.  News punch wrote an aggregated version of the radio interview but was also deleted later down the line. According to Macaulay Culkin the only reason he’s still alive was because he was a smart kid and he was too famous to be killed unlike some other kids. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            During the interview, Culkin claimed children in the entertainment industry “learn very quickly which of them want to abuse you and which of them have even darker taste.” Explaining that some of the Hollywood executives wear “skin trophies”. asked to explain what that phrase means, Culking said “They wear shoes belts and wallets made out of the skin of children that they have ritually murdered”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Have you seen leather products made from human skin? It has a very distinctive look. Learned at a very young age to identify it,” said 37 year-old Culkin, who has been living in Paris since 2003. “ I was 11 the first time I saw it. I was filming home alone 2 in new York,” Culking said . “ I was ushered into a back room on the set. There was a guy in there, a powerful executive type. You know what I mean?” “He tried to make me relax. Gave me a can of coke. Started telling me about the nature of the industry. Basically he wanted me to cut my parents out. He wanted to be my guardian. He said he would make me into the biggest teen star in history. He said I have it all, he said I have to get rid of my parents. I was like dude, I’m 11! And he said you are man now.” “He started breathing in real shallow. My experience with perverts kicked in. I could tell he was interested in me.” “He licked his lips and told me I was very handsome. I  think I managed to say thank you and started thinking of how I could get the f*ck out of there. ” Macaulay Culkin said the Hollywood executive then dropped a heavy hint about where the skin came from he used to make his patent leather shoes
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “he asked me if I knew Heather O’Rourke.” 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “yeah, I remembered her. I grew up watching poltergeist. I remember her in happy days. She was so cute.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            “I vomited all over his sheos.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            These are some sick allegations, I cant find the original interview it has been deleted. These red shoes have been common among elites. These red shoes have also been portrayed in media like, “The Man with One Red Shoe ” played by Tom Hanks another alleged pedo, the macdonalds mascot and many more.

        <h3> WHY?</h3>
        <br>
        <P>
            There is a lot of material I haven't even touched on here that suggests that the motivations of Pizzagate (in general) are about much more than pedophilia. Simply put, it is a cabal that worships Satan and/or other dark deities, believes that occult rituals and child sacrifices will "make a deal with the devil" to ensure fame and fortune, and believes that the blood of children who have been tortured is supercharged with adrenochrome and will grant long-lasting youth and beauty. Furthermore, once you are in, you're in deep, with your own initiation likely producing video evidence of unspeakable crimes that forever bind you to the group.
