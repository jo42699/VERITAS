        <h2> SEAN COMBS (DIDDY)</h2>
        <br>
        <P>
            Sean John Combs (born November 4, 1969), also known by his stage name Diddy, formerly Puff Daddy and P. Diddy, is an American rapper, record producer, and record executive. A three-time Grammy Award winner, he is credited with the discovery and development of musical artists including the Notorious B.I.G., Mary J. Blige, and Usher. In September 2024, he was arrested on charges of racketeering, sex trafficking by force, and transportation for purposes of prostitution.  
        </P>
        <br>
        <p>
            Born in Harlem and raised in Mount Vernon, New York, Combs worked as a talent director at Uptown Records before founding his own record label, Bad Boy Records in 1993. He embarked on his recording career following the success of his first signee, the Notorious B.I.G., for whom he served as manager and hype man. Combs's debut studio album, No Way Out (1997), received critical acclaim, peaked atop the Billboard 200, and received septuple platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America. Two singles from the album, "Can't Nobody Hold Me Down" and "I'll Be Missing You", topped the US Billboard Hot 100—the latter was the first hip hop song to debut atop the chart. His second and third albums, Forever (1999) and The Saga Continues... (2001), both peaked at number two on the Billboard 200, while his fourth, Press Play (2006), peaked atop the chart. Combs then formed the musical group Diddy – Dirty Money with R&B singers Kalenna Harper and Dawn Richard to release the collaborative album Last Train to Paris (2010), which peaked at number seven and was supported by the single "Coming Home". His fifth studio album, The Love Album: Off the Grid (2023), received moderate critical and commercial response.

        <h2> DIDDY PARTIES  </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            “Aint no party like a diddy party” ,Combs’s reputation for throwing parties predates his music-mogul days. As a Howard University student, he was already hosting events that sometimes attracted up to 1,000 people, according to Harlem World Magazine. He worked as a rap party promoter earlier in his career and, as a household name, partied with celebs in the Hamptons, Los Angeles, Miami, Morocco, St. Tropez, and Ibiza. Diddy parties, named after the iconic music mogul Sean "Diddy" Combs, have become synonymous with opulence, celebrity, and an unparalleled atmosphere of celebration. These gatherings, often marked by extravagant themes, top-tier entertainment, and a guest list featuring the crème de la crème of the entertainment industry, encapsulate the essence of modern celebrity culture. <br>
        </p>
        <p>
            At the heart of a Diddy party is a meticulous attention to detail. From lavish décor to gourmet catering, every aspect is curated to create an immersive experience. Diddy is known for his penchant for grandeur; thus, these events often take place in luxurious venues, ranging from penthouse suites to sprawling estates. The ambiance is enhanced by high-profile DJs or live performances, often featuring A-list artists who elevate the party to an unforgettable experience.

        <h2>Kimberly Antwinette Porter </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Porter was from Columbus, Georgia. She began modeling as a teenager and was also a debutante. In 1988, she graduated from Columbus High School and moved to Atlanta, Georgia, to further her modeling career. She appeared in films and TV series such as: The Brothers (2001), Wicked Wicked Games (2006–2007), The System Within (2006), Single Ladies (2011), and Mama, I Want to Sing! (2012). Porter appeared in a number of music videos, and she worked as a receptionist at Uptown Records, after being hired by founder Andre Harrell. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Kim porter was dated P. Diddy on and off from 1994-2007. They had three children together, Twins Jessie James and D'Lila , Son Christian (20 years old) and Quincy (27 years old), who is Kim's son from a previous marriage but was later adopted by Diddy. Kim mysteriously died from Pneumonia at age 47 in 2018, before she died she was going to release a tell all book about her life story and relationship with Diddy but that was cut after her sudden passing. But after the arrest of diddy the book was finally released and the revelations in this book are insane. When she died she was put in a gold casket and her body was guarded by 24hour security. The pathologist in charge of her autopsy mysteriously died after ruling her death was foul play and replaced with another. In this (tell all) we learn what she wanted to say to the world, keep in mind this book was published by another person not her and according to the publisher he was given on a flash drive. I’m going to give a summery of what happens in the book and the disturbing allegations made.

        <h1> KIM's LOST WORDS</h1>
        <br>
        <h2> THE BEGINING </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            I can’t type the whole book so I’m just going to paraphrase it. Kim grew up in Georgia and after high school she started getting modelling jobs and she knew she had to get out of Georgia if she wanted to make it big. She moved to the west coast where she met her husband Al (al b sure) an American singer, they fell in love and got married at 19 and she had a child named Quincy. Long story short it did not work out and they divorced but they remained friends. Then she meets Sean Combs they are both working at the uptown label he’s up and coming but not big yet, turns out he’s really into her and he’s making advances and she just kind of yeah he’s cool they go on a few date nothing serious no big deal, then they meet again at an event and he’s putting on the charm telling her she’s beautiful and all and rizzing her up she’s saying no but they eventually go out again. Now they’ve been dating for a year and she was referencing how he kept begging for her to do it for him again and its alluding to pegging him and she is kind of like Sean no I don’t want to do that again and she kinda makes a sly comment 'cause he's like oh like like I want you to blank me like that again and then she goes isn't Clive the one blanking you Clive Davis implying that Clive is blanking him and then he slaps her hard and before she can't even react he's like on the floor Oh my God I'm so sorry I'm so sorry she ends up leaving and he keeps like sending flowers and gifts to her house and she's like no I don't want anything to do with you but then they run into each other and event again he comes up to her she's like get away from me and then he sits her down he's like no you know I love you nothing's gonna keep us apart I love your son like your son is my son blah blah blah and that like gets her because she's like OK he is really good with my son and so she then turns and looks at him and she's like OK let's get coffee, she ends up giving him another chance.

            She says the year passed pretty well they didn't have any problems but then Sean is getting into voodoo and he's putting curses on people OK this is where Mary J Blige enters the chat so I guess he starts working with her and then he admits that he's actually hooked up with her and so Kim gets angry but then he's like hey why don't we have a threesome the three of us and Kim's kind of like I mean she is pretty I don't know so they end up having a threesome she's like I don't know  I'm not into women but exploring my sexuality was enticing so whatever over the years they brought many other women into their bedroom so they were kind of like they were open one day she comes home and al her ex-husband is at the kitchen table her boyfriend Sean which is super awkward and she's like OK this is weird and he says you know the awkwardness between all of us had passed a long time ago but it's still weird that the two of them are hanging out in my home like her ex-husband and her current boyfriend and the father of her son you know and then after they've been drinking Al (AL BE SURE) is kind of like you know we've all been together just like not together like we've all been together but not at the same time she's kind of like the wtf do you mean and then Sean and him are kind of like encouraging her to have a threesome with them and she's kind of like first of all this is crazy and also like what if it goes weird and like what about my son but also I do kind of love both of you and like it could be fun like I don't know so she's like alright let's do it and then as it's happening it's alluded in the book it's it's X out but it's pretty clear threesome the threesome becomes a twosome between Sean and Al and she's kind of like what the **** so she freaks out and leaves and sean's like babe come back it's like totally cool like don't even worry and you kind of gather that like maybe this isn't the first time that they've done this and she's weirded out by this she couldn't look at him the same for a while it's just it's strange. She also mentions she found a vault where he kept all of his encounters on video.

        <h3> East coast west coast </h3>
        <br>
        <p>
            Biggie and Tupac get mentioned in this chapter. So biggie has taken over East Coast hip hop and then Sean is basically orchestrating everything in the industry like he's got people helping write rap lyrics he's got people helping produce beats and he's working with people who are like deciding who's gonna be the new the next it person and Sean is sleeping with a lot of people including very powerful men within the industry she says like the names that that are like they would blow your mind if you knew some of these names and also a lot of people you've never heard of but that are really important in the industry she also says he started hosting parties with fancy names which were basically just a way to have orgies. when she met Tupac her and Sean were in an open relationship and she liked Tupac so they would hook up a lot her and Tupac would sleep together but then one day things take a turn because she's hanging out and Tupac is there and Sean is there and he knows that they've hooked up and he basically turns the Tupac and he's like my baby is bad right and tupac's like yeah and he's like yeah she is very uncomfortable and then sean's like who do you think is better like, like who do you think is like better at doing it to her and Tupac is like bro what? And he's like let's let's find out like who's better like I bet my dick is bigger than yours and tupac's like what the **** and Kim's also like dude what the **** super disrespectful and he's like yeah let's see right now like let's see who can make her cum the fastest and like it seemed like Tupac then says like are you about to take your dick out right now and it's just bad cause she's like you're disrespecting me tupac's pissed 'cause he's like first of all this is awkward second of all I told you 100 times like I'm not I'm not into you Sean kept like making advances tupac's I'm not I'm not gonna hook up with you and this is awkward so he leaves.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Things are very contentious between Sean and Tupac like they avoid each other he's actually now avoiding Kim as well so like he wants nothing to do with either of them and they're just tension between them she even said like there was a couple times where it seemed like who's gonna throw a punch then she says one day she walks into the studio in the morning and she overhears the conversation. Sean is having a conversation with who she calls Jimmy the henchman and what she hears him say is and I quote pac don't leave that ******* studio alive and then she says I don't think I was meant to hear that so she continues like she didn't hear that and she's like oh good morning guys I'm ordering breakfast what do you want they place their little orders like right and she definitely heard it and as this Jimmy guy is leaving the studio he says to Sean great let's make that happen so like confirmed and he says I'll make the call.

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
            I'm gonna type this part verbatim because I think it's important " I wasn't in the studio the night pop survived being shot thank God from what I understand Sean and Chris saw pac at the studio after he'd been shot and did nothing, after being shot pac made it to the elevator and tried to escape but it stopped on the floor that Sean and Chris were on. when the doors opened they saw him lying on the elevator floor riddled with bullets the fact that they didn't call an ambulance although they saw that pac was sitting there lying swimming in a pool of his own blood would be all the evidence pac ever needed, he of course assumed that they placed the hit and Tupac was a soldier but this is not something that will be unanswered. He lost the testicle but he survived she says it was orchestrated and Sean puffy Combs was the orchestrator at this point she knows she's got to get out so when they they go to dinner at a restaurant and it's like really fancy it's the two of them it's public and so she was thinking this would be a good time to break up with him but as he walks into the restaurant he's on the phone with someone she doesn't know who he's on the phone with but she hears him say this we're gonna release who shot you now so they had a song called who shot you and he's intentionally releasing it and it's gonna be BIG making the song of course they're gonna think BIG was talking about pop that's the whole point nobody would give a **** about a diss track against LL ******* cool J do you know how much money we're gonna make with this kind of rap beef so he knowingly put the hit on Tupac and then knowingly encouraged a song from BIG that would make it look like it was him that did it so we can make money off of it and then she's like OK maybe now is not the best time to break up with him and as he's getting the phone he says we dropped that **** tomorrow there's gonna be blood in the street blank they missed pac is alive let's capitalize on that **** when he responds it's just gonna mean more money.

            She gets off the phone and she doesn't look very happy and he's like what's wrong and she's like oh nothing but like she was intimate with Tupac she like she liked him so she's like this this not this is not good and he's like oh Are you sure you're fine she's like yeah but she's like sean's not stupid so she's like pretending that she's cool but he can tell that something's wrong so as she's saying like yeah I'm fine he takes her hand and he squeezes it until it hurts and he says that's wonderful because seeing you walk in the office while I was talking about killing that MF and you not saying **** to me had me just a little bit concerned and he's squeezing her hand so that it hurts she's like you're hurting me and then he keeps squeezing and he's like you're pretending you didn't hear anything was a sign of your loyalty not something I should be concerned about right and so she said she had no choice but to say what he wanted and she was like yeah and so he let go and he's like good and then he says remember I'm the big D and then he's like great let's have whine and it's at this moment that she realizes she's trapped. <br>At this point she said Sean has a bad temper he yells sometimes he's roughed me up a couple of times but he's never like bruised her and he's never put a hand on Quincy her son she says at that time I never thought of him touching Quincy in any way which she goes on to say the last time he put his hands on me it was because I enjoyed Jamie Foxx(an American actor) too much but she says well he enjoyed him too(implying the had gay sex). Sean gets so jealous so then a third person a third person joins and then she says the Sean's may share a bed together from time to time but thankfully I was never asked to join and then Sean Carter (Jay-Z) is like oh I thought we were meeting in private and he did he's like oh I got it I wanted to discuss something with her it's fine go ahead yadda yadda and then Jay-Z says that it's true biggie and Tupac were about to launch their own label together literally notorious, the beef between Tupac and biggie never existed they were about to start a label together.

            At one of the infamous parties right she's like it was threesomes we were swapping partners our sex life was crazy but I got to do things with him that I would never get to do with a straight man and he cared about me so you know it was becoming more and more apparent he preferred men. So she wakes up in the morning and left the bedroom where she was with Jada Pinkett and Sean happened to be coming out of the bedroom with blank and Will Smith yes blank attended the parties from time to time we don't know who blank is, I could see him and will kind of snuggled up in the bed together I was grateful that I wasn't asked to join I really like blank i wanted to get back home to Quincy before he woke up but Sean was like no let's have a talk and she says she didn't really have a choice because he was getting more and more violent when he didn't get what he wanted he didn't really want to fight so he sat down and as he's sitting down this blank person comes out of the room, sean's wearing boxers blank is naked and blank addressed them said hey good morning when he turned around to close the door there was dried stuff(ejaculate) on his back the person came over pulled out a chair to sit down next to them. Sean is smiling and he's like this is this East Coast West Coast beef is more lucrative than I thought but it's getting dangerous and then the other guy blank is like well business first thing in the morning like crazy, they're like why are we talking business right now blank smiles blah blah blah Sean says I can't protect everybody especially if someone is no longer going to be on my label and blank says Sean are you saying what I think you're saying and then Sean says it's taxing on my resources to protect people someone that isn't 100% on my team can't get 100% of my protection then this blank person says OK so to be clear if something happened to someone on your team and he made quote marks with his fingers that leaving your label <br> anyway it would be considered out of your control and she's like wait are they talking about Biggie is Sean saying he won't protect Biggie anymore she says at this point I was too young too naive too hungover to realize that what they're talking about is not a lack of protection but a hit and she's like where did this come from the world was about to lose biggie. At this point she says to him she like she has to speak up she's like but Sean he hasn't left yet they're just rumors are you really gonna let him die because of some rumors and Sean says I know when I'm being betrayed I'm not killing anyone but I am not protecting somebody that doesn't have my back 150% she's like OK maybe I can play the money card and she's like Sean he's bringing in so much money like you put so much money investing into him like are you gonna throw that away he's like if he leaves he takes all the money I invested into creating him but if I can't protect him something terrible does happen then the money I would make off of his death would blow away all the money we need so far and he says, he's worth more to me dead than alive then this blank person says I get that a lot of people want him dead too without your protection he doesn't stand a chance in Cali. Biggie is going to die this is crazy I dare not say anything else about it then diddy walks over to a safe behind a picture pulls out a bag marked with blank's name turns the blank and says that's why you're worth your weight in gold do you understand me here's something for you to take care of your people and he's like I love you.

          she's saying at this point their relationship is not going great he's put his hands on her like many times and they're on and off so one day he calls and he's like hey we've been broken up for a while this time and then he's like listen I don't want anyone to know about my proclivities and she's like OK so you don't want people to know about you being gay?  and he like loses it and then when you see this in in the news it's not real and she's like what are you talking about and he's like I'm only doing it for the press and she's like doing what and he's like she knows what this is she's just pretending to cover me and she's like what are you talking about and he's like publicly I'm going to be dating somebody else a video girl and it's still like protect his sexuality I guess they get into a huge fight basically and she's like OK you're gay and she's like I'm done with you and they get off the phone she said for a while she was happy that Sean was out of her life, the sex parties were getting out of control Chris(Biggie) is still alive but she's like worried about him and then she's at her house one day and Sean shows up to her house he's like are you waiting for someone she's like no and she's like but you're dating someone and I can **** whoever I want he loses his shit he slams her to the ground pulls out a big boy weapon put it on the end of the table turns to her calmly and like pointed at her and she's like please stop my son my son is here like cut it out and he's like you're mine you don't have a choice in that now I can't live without you and she's like Sean that's not love but he's like this is just for dramatic effect I would never actually shoot you if I was going to no one would ever trace it to me, do you know how many people I've had to take care of over the years it would be quiet something in your food or in your drink something that would never get back to me

Apparently Faith, Biggies girlfriend was put in place by diddy to monitor him and she intentionally hooked up with pac to fuel the beef. she was well aware of what was about to happen to biggie and she did nothing. They had a child together. this is messed up.

            Apparently this is called Eroto-comatose lucidity it is a technique of sex magic known best by its  formulation by English author and occultist Aleister Crowley in 1912, but which has several variations and is used in a number of ways by different spiritual communities. A common form of the ritual uses repeated sexual stimulation (but not to physical orgasm) to place the individual in a state between full sleep and full wakefulness as well as exhaustion, allowing the practitioner to commune with their god.

            She did some acting and she had coffee with the producer and the producer sent flowers to the house and said like in the car like it was so nice to meet you we should do it again, Sean finds out and  freaks out and like smacks the **** out of her and he's like, you've had my baby you can't do anything without me knowing and she's like it was just a producer and he's like who's this PRODUCER! throwing **** flipping tables and then he hits her with a chair he takes a chair and hits her with it. She doesn't remember anything she wakes up in a hospital room her arms in a cast hanging from a sling her face hurts eyebrows in immense pain yeah and when she makes up Sean is there with her he's like I'm sorry, she's like get away from me and she's like save it for the lawyers that they're in a private room so even if she like screams who's gonna help her it's like stay away from my kids blah blah blah he's like "you're gonna use the kids against me?" and then he goes, tell them what that you had a car accident they'll pity you that you hit your head. He was going to make her look crazy. He spent the next six months helping her heal working his way back into her life and into her bed she said I was so stupid, well and then it says from what I understand the producer died of PNEUMONIA. She got pregnant again and he wanted to do the same ritual stuff, turns out this is some kind of energy ritual thing. Their trying to take energy from the baby by gangbanging her. She was like this is gonna be my last party my body is never gonna be touched by this many people again. She says whenever I tried dating someone else they would end up dead from pneumonia. What the HELL. She said she has a plan but its gonna be dangerous.
