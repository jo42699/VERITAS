        <br>
        <p>
            Marina Abramović born November 30, 1946 is a Serbian conceptual and performance artist. Her work explores body art, endurance art, the relationship between the performer and audience, the limits of the body, and the possibilities of the mind. Being active for over four decades, Abramović refers to herself as the "grandmother of performance art".She pioneered a new notion of identity by bringing in the participation of observers, focusing on "confronting pain, blood, and physical limits of the body".In 2007, she founded the Marina Abramović Institute (MAI), a non-profit foundation for performance art

            Abramović was raised by her grandparents until she was six years old Her grandmother was deeply religious and Abramović "spent her childhood in a church following her grandmother's rituals—candles in the morning, the priest coming for different occasions".When she was six, her brother was born, and she began living with her parents while also taking piano, French, and English lessons. Although she did not take art lessons, she took an early interest in art and enjoyed painting as a child.

        <h2>WHAT IS SPIRIT COOKING??</h2>
        <br>
        <P>
            Spirit Cooking is an event and central ritual started by Marina Abramović, who is an artist known for her gory performances and occultist rituals. The ritual itself has deep influences from old occultist rituals performed prior to consumption of eucharistic meals during worship. In the 21st century the ritual "spirit cooking," popularized by Marina Abramović, has gained interest as an artistic experience, especially due to predominant news coverage in the late stages of the United States presidential election, 2016.
        </P>
        <br>
        <p>
            The origins of Spirit Cooking can be found in the preludes to production of the Cake of Light material, a sacrament in the religion of Thelema which was founded by Aleister Crowley. The original ritual, not of the same name, is performed during the cooking of Cake of Light wafers that is to be consumed during a religious gathering. The ingredients of the Cake of Light include honey, oil, menstrual blood and sperm. The sacrament is meant to symbolize the union between the microcosm, Man, and the macrocosm, the Divine, which is a representation of one of the prime maxims in Hermeticism "As Above, So Below." The consumption of the Cake of Light is a fulfillment of the sacred circle of the connection between Man and the Divine. The ceremony of "spirit cooking" is the modern rendition of the 19th and 20th century rituals of the Cake of Light.

        <br>
        <p>
            In Spirit Cooking, Marina uses pigs blood (which most resembles human blood) as a medium to connect the spirit world with the material world.
            The ritual takes place in the kitchen, which is considered the heart of the home.
            The goal of the ceremony is to convert matter into energy so spirits can feed on it.
            Marina "...derives her inspiration from the popular belief that the spirits still need food even though it is no longer solid, but in the form of light, sound, and emotions."
            In the video dated from 1997 called Spirit Cooking, Marina is seen writing in blood various statements, including "Mix Fresh Breast Milk With Fresh Sperm," "Fresh Morning Urine Sprinkle Over Nightmare Dreams," and "With a Sharp Knife Cut Deeply Into Your Middle Finger Eat The Pain."
            The video shows Spirit Cooking appearing to be a combination of an artistic performance and an occult ceremony.

        <h2>SPIRIRIT COOKING EVENT</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            These spirit cooking events are very bizarre, they have occultic themes of cannibalism, occult symbols, food with realistic appearance to humans, consumption of blood and other crazy themes. With ticket prices ranging from $25,000-$100,000 for those who paid $100,000 they were seated at a round table while a nude model was laid down in the middle of the table with a skelecton placed on her, the guest list at these events are almost as crazy ranging from A list musicians, tech CEO’s, Banking moguls, Politicians, Hollywood actors it almost makes you wonder why all of them are participating in such an event especially with Marina’s ties to satanism, are they all in on it and more importantly why does she have so much influence. These event are often very disturbing and when anybody raises questions about the nature of these events you will be labeled a conspiracy theorist, in these events there are human looking sculptures on the tables and in some cases food is being eaten off living people. And these (elite’s) partake in such events like its so normal, there is nothing normal about this

        <h2> Marina Abramović INFLUENCE </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Why is Marina Abramovic linked to so many powerful people? I do not know the answer to that question. For someone with strong ties to the occult its strange that so many celebrities, CEO’s, Bankers and politicians look up to her. In 2016 there were leaked emails between her and John Podesta ( a democratic politician), why would such a high profile Politician be engaging in such bizarre rituals? It was alleged that the democratic party engaged in satanic rituals , these claims where shut down quickly by mainstream media but with the nature of these events and the leaked emails its hard to convince people that nothing strange is happening.
            From pairing with the Rockefellar’s , doing colabs with Microsoft and performing art with high profile A list actors and musicians it is hard not to say that they are all involved in some occult practices. Its also strange the way so many power people look up to her reminiscence of how church members treat a priest.

        <h2>THELEMA</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Thelema is a spiritual philosophy and religious movement developed in the early 20th century by the British occultist Aleister Crowley. The term "Thelema" derives from the Greek word for "will," encapsulating one of its core tenets: the idea of True Will, which posits that every individual has a unique purpose or path in life that they should strive to discover and fulfill.
            At the heart of Thelema lies the maxim "Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law." This phrase suggests that the pursuit of one’s own true will should guide ethical and moral behavior. It encourages individuals to break free from societal constraints and to pursue their innermost desires, as long as they do not infringe upon the freedoms of others. This concept is complemented by the phrase "Love is the law, love under will," which emphasizes that love, as a guiding force, should inform how one exercises their will.

        <h2>MARINA ABRAMOVIć TIES TO THELEMA</h2>   
        <br>
        <p>
            In thelema the host is called the cake of light which is made of flour, bodily fluids and sacred oils, this is known as spirit cooking. Thelema is an occult order that draws many famous artists such as JAY Z although Marina claims she has no ties to the occult and spirit cooking is her independent idea it is clear that that is simply false. Its clear that satanism is not hidden among celebrities especially in Hollywood and most celebrities worship pagan gods and perform occult rituals for their own personal reasons it is left for us to speculate what happens behind closed doors.
