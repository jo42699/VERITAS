        <h2>BOPHOMET</h2>
        <p>
            Baphomet is a deity that the Knights Templar were accused of worshipping that subsequently became incorporated into various occult and Western esoteric traditions. The name Baphomet appeared in trial transcripts for the Inquisition of the Knights Templar starting in 1307. It first came into popular English usage in the 19th century during debate and speculation on the reasons for the suppression of the Templar order. Baphomet is a symbol of balance in various occult and mystical traditions, the origin of which some occultists have attempted to link with the Gnostics and Templars, although occasionally purported to be a deity or a demon.[3] Since 1856 the name Baphomet has been associated with the "Sabbatic Goat" image drawn by Éliphas Lévi, composed of binary elements representing the "symbolization of the equilibrium of opposites": half-human and half-animal, male and female, and good and evil. Lévi's intention was to symbolize his concept of balance, with Baphomet representing the goal of perfect social order.

        <h2>Knights Templar</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Knights Templar, was a French military order of the Catholic faith, and one of the wealthiest and most popular military orders in Western Christianity. They were founded c. 1119 to defend pilgrims on their way to Jerusalem, with their headquarters located there on the Temple Mount, and existed for nearly two centuries during the Middle Ages.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Officially endorsed by the Roman Catholic Church by such decrees as the papal bull Omne datum optimum of Pope Innocent II, the Templars became a favoured charity throughout Christendom and grew rapidly in membership and power. The Templar knights, in their distinctive white mantles with a red cross, were among the most skilled fighting units of the Crusades. They were prominent in Christian finance; non-combatant members of the order, who made up as much as 90% of their members, managed a large economic infrastructure throughout Christendom. They developed innovative financial techniques that were an early form of banking, building a network of nearly 1,000 commanderies and fortifications across Europe and the Holy Land  They were accused of worshiping BAPHAMET a hellish deity and not Christ whom their operations seemed to revolve around. They were executed and dispersed by the pope.

        <h2>THELEMA  (Aleister Crowley)</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Alexander Crowley; 12 October 1875 – 1 December 1947) was an English occultist, ceremonial magician, poet, philosopher, political theorist, novelist, mountaineer, and painter. He founded the religion of Thelema, identifying himself as the prophet entrusted with guiding humanity into the Æon of Horus in the early 20th century. A prolific writer, he published widely over the course of his life.Born to a wealthy family in Royal Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, Crowley rejected his parents' fundamentalist Christian Plymouth Brethren faith to pursue an interest in Western esotericism
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The relationship between Thelema and Baphomet is rich and symbolic, reflecting themes of duality and individual will. Developed by Aleister Crowley in the early 20th century, Thelema emphasizes the pursuit of True Will, encouraging individuals to understand and fulfill their unique purpose.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Baphomet, often depicted as a winged humanoid goat with both male and female features, symbolizes the union of opposites—light and dark, male and female. This figure has been embraced by various occult traditions and is central to Crowley’s teachings. In Thelemic thought, Baphomet represents the integration of these dualities, mirroring the journey toward self-discovery and enlightenment.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Both Thelema and Baphomet challenge societal norms and moral binaries, advocating for personal freedom and the acceptance of all aspects of human experience. Together, they illustrate a path toward spiritual liberation and the realization of one’s true potential.A lot of modern day celebrities seem to be fans of Crowley who is a well known Satanist, people like jay Z, lady gaga , Marina Abramovic and many more all seem to follow in his footsteps.

        <h2> SATANISM IN HOLLYWOOD</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            It is no secrete that satanism exists in Hollywood this is a topic that often elicits strong reactions, blending myth, rumor, and genuine artistic expression. The entertainment industry has long been a fertile ground for exploring themes of rebellion, the occult, and the supernatural, which has led to the perception that Hollywood harbors a significant undercurrent of satanic influence.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            One of the main reasons for this perception is the frequent use of satanic imagery and themes in films, music, and television. From horror classics like *The Exorcist* and *Rosemary’s Baby* to contemporary series like *American Horror Story*, the portrayal of Satan and occult practices serves to evoke fear, challenge moral boundaries, and explore the darker aspects of human nature. These narratives often tap into societal anxieties about power, control, and the unknown, reflecting broader cultural fears and fascinations. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            Moreover, the rise of certain celebrity figures and the controversies surrounding them has fueled the belief that there are secretive groups promoting satanic ideologies within Hollywood. High-profile artists and filmmakers occasionally embrace provocative imagery or claim to draw inspiration from the occult, blurring the lines between ARTISTIC EXPRESSION and ACTUAL BELIEF. This has led to conspiracy theories that suggest a hidden agenda within the industry, often lacking concrete evidence yet persistent in popular discourse.With these symbolisms being shoved down our throat in almost all forms of media, tv, music or even everyday entertainment its hard to sit here and say it is just artistic expression, this is no longer “COINCIDNCE” or “expression of art” it is blatant satanism and its clear there is some kind of agenda.

        <h2>WHAT IS THE AGENDA?  </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Why are all these symbols and signs in our faces all the time, what is the plan? I don’t know the answer to that but according to Kat Williams an American stand-up comedian and actor who has been on a frenzy for exposing the industry revealed that Hollywood is ran by Satanists who worship the transgender pagan god and over the years have been slowly indoctrinating the world into their agender. He said on the joe Rogan experience “20 years ago I knew transgenders was gonna be a thing it wasn’t because I was a prophet, it’s because I understood what was going on, the earliest I have seen that word transgender was Baphomet the transgender and calling people the goat will be normalized over the sheep being the most popular reference ”. According to him in the industry men where forced to where dresses in order to get to the next level and the industry likes to put men in dresses not just for comedic purposes but to send a message, this is just one of the crazy allegations he made this year. But tbh lets just look at it a few years ago someone being transgender was looked down on or even seen as crazy, but now its like if you even question it or make any comments about people cutting off their breasts and pumping themselves with hormones or even children deciding they want to be the opposite sex you will be labeled as “TRANSPHOBIC” and cancelled by society, you could say they succeeded with their agenda but is that all and what are we missing now?
