        <h2>HUMAN SACRIFICES</h2>
        <P>
            Throughout history, the worship practices of various religions have continued to intrigue and provoke curiosity in people. One of the most fascinating ancient deities, Baal, stands out for his popularity in the Levantine pantheon and his portrayal as a fertility and storm god. In this blog post, we’ll explore who Baal is and why his cult was revered so highly among Canaanite culture, including the intriguing ritual sacrifices and the mythological aspects of Baal
        </P>
        <br>
        <h2>BAAL</h2>
        <P>
            Baal was a god worshipped by the Canaanites, who resided in the Levant region during the antiquity period. He was part of the Levantine pantheon of divine beings that included goddesses like Anat and Asherah. It was quite common for him to be worshipped alongside these other gods and goddesses.

            Baal worship practices involved ritual sacrifice including children and idolatry, which is the worship of idols or physical representations of deities. This practice was closely associated with the beliefs and culture surrounding Baal’s cult. Baal was perceived as a powerful god who controlled natural phenomena, especially thunder and storms. Worshipers of Baal believed that he had the power to bring rain and fertility to the land and crops. Hence, Baal was perceived as a fertility deity and was revered by the people for his ability to provide prosperity to their communities.

        <h2>MOLOCH</h2>
        <br>

        <h2>Who Is Moloch </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Moloch has often been portrayed as a bull-headed idol with outstretched hands over fire and one of the alleged symbols of the deity is a horned owl,  historical and archaeological communities still debate Moloch’s identity and influence, he seems to have been a god of the Canaanites, which was a religion born out of a combination of ancient Semitic faiths.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            What’s known about Moloch largely comes from Judaic texts outlawing the worship of him and the writings of ancient Greek and Roman authors.
            The cult of Moloch is believed to have been practiced by the people of the Levant region from at least the early Bronze Age, and images of his bullish head with a child burning in his belly persist until the medieval times
            
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            His name likely derives from the Hebrew word melech, which usually stands for “king.” There are also references to a Molock in Ancient Greek translations of old Judaic texts as well. These date back to the Second Temple period between 516 B.C. and 70 C.E., before the Second Temple of Jerusalem was destroyed by the Romans.Moloch is most frequently referred to in Leviticus. Here is a passage from Leviticus 18:21, condemning child sacrifice, “Do not allow any of your children to be offered to Molech.”

            Passages in Kings, Isaiah, and Jeremiah also refer to a tophet, which has been defined as both a location in ancient Jerusalem where there was a special bronze statue internally heated by fire, or the statue itself — into which children were apparently thrown for sacrifice.

        <h2>WHY DID PEOPLE PERFORM HUMAN SACRIFICES</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            Human sacrifice, the offering of the life of a human being to a deity. The occurrence of human sacrifice can usually be related to the recognition of human blood as the sacred life force. Bloodless forms of killing, however, such as strangulation and drowning, have been used in some cultures. The killing of a human being, or the substitution of an animal for a person, has often been part of an attempt to commune with a god and to participate in divine life. Human life, as the most valuable material for sacrifice, has also been offered in an attempt at expiation. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            There are two primary types of human sacrifice: the offering of a human being to a god and the entombment or slaughter of servants or slaves intended to accompany the deceased into the afterlife. The latter practice was more common. In various places in Africa, where human sacrifice was connected with ancestor worship, some of the slaves of the deceased were buried alive with him, or they were killed and laid beneath him in his grave. The Dahomey instituted especially elaborate sacrifices at yearly ceremonies related to the cult of deceased kings. Excavations in Egypt and elsewhere in the ancient Middle East have revealed that numerous servants were at times interred with the funerary equipment of a member of the royal family in order to provide that person with a retinue in the next life. The Chinese practice of burying the emperor’s retinue with him continued intermittently until the 17th century.
        </p>
        <br>
        <p>
            The sacrificial offering of humans to a god has been well attested only in a few cultures. In what is now Mexico the belief that the sun needed human nourishment led to the sacrifice of thousands of victims annually in the Aztec and Nahua calendrical maize (corn) ritual. The Inca confined wholesale sacrifices to the occasion of the accession of a ruler. The burning of children seems to have occurred in Assyrian and Canaanite religions and at various times among the Israelites. Among the African Asante, the victims sacrificed as first-fruit offerings during the Festival of New Yams were usually criminals, though slaves also were killed.

        <h2>  Bohemian Grove  </h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The Bohemian Grove is a restricted 2,700-acre (1,100-hectare) campground in Monte Rio, California. Founded in 1878, it belongs to a private gentlemen's club known as the Bohemian Club. In mid-July each year, the Bohemian Grove hosts a more than two-week encampment of some of the most prominent men in the world. In 2001 a conspiracy theorist by the name of Alex Jones snuck into one of these events, at the time the “Bohemian Grove conspiracy” was nothing more than just a tin foil conspiracy where the most powerful men on earth go to perform pagan rituals like that sounds insane why would people of such caliber perform such crude rituals. A man took it upon himself to prove it was more than just a conspiracy so in 2001 he discovered where these events took place snuck in and recorded the whole thing. <br>Former presidents, senators, CEO’s, Bankers, governors, ex-presidents where all in attendance of this event. After recording all of this he exposed them and their satanic occult practices. In these tapes they where seen in robes chanting and performing rituals while burning an effigy of a human. They had a massive statue of MOLOCH a pagan god, who was known for the human sacrifices done in his name. when this all came to light it was the talk of the era. Conspiracy theories where no longer conspiracies, some of the people in attendance of this event where confronted about it but they panicked and went into hiding. Alex jones was known as the man who exposed the elites. Mainstream media played it of and refused to cover it claiming it was just tradition for good luck. Now we know the people who run things in the world all take part in these kinds of events, it really makes you wonder what these people do behind closed doors.
