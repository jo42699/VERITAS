        What happened to the boy who got everything he ever wanted? I believe the answer to that is he wanted more. Think about this, what happens to people when they get everything. All the money all the cars all the houses, they tend to get bored. People think that when they have money and all the material things in the world, when they work all their lives they will just sit back and watch the sunset but what happens when you get all those things and you still have the drive, the ambition, the hunger you had when you first started. Billionaires, millionaires and people who have all the money, have had all the women all the experiences are more likely to want more extreme things. Like ice cream, when we first had vanilla it was mind blowing, the best thing ever but then we got bored of it and we moved to chocolate then mint then bubblegum then whiskey then "Vanilla, bubblegum Strawberry Swirl with a Rainbow of Sprinkles." We keep looking for the new flavor to give us that first experience. I’m sure you’re wondering why is this guy talking about ice scream hold up let me cook.

        To fully understand this concept we are going to look at a movie. The movie is called “eyes wide shut” by Stanly Kubrick. This is an erotic psychological horror movie about a high-profile doctor who after smoking some weed with his wife discovered she had fantasies about other men and almost cheats on him. After learning this information his male ego is hurt so much that one night he goes on an adventure with the aim of cheating on his wife. He then ends up in a jazz club and meets this pianist who tells him about a secrete sex cult who he plays piano for blindfolded. He is then interested and begs him for the passport to get in and the attire. He then sneaks into this cult in a multi-million dollar mansion and sees things he was never meant to see, he then gets caught and he discovers the power of this society and its high-profile members. It is also important to state that Kubrick had a heart attack six days after showing the final cut of this movie. According to rumors that movie was never meant to be seen given that the movie was in production hell, apparently there are 25 minutes of the movie that have never been seen before. Nobody knows what the 25 minutes contain there are some speculation that it had to be removed because it contains children. Kubrick claims there is an element of truth in this movie and often said things like NASA hired him to fake the moon landing and the world is run by pedophiles some say he was just crazy.

        We all know about the infamous Hollywood parties, those crazy Los Angeles masked mansion parties with the crazy decorations and the top tier guest list with only the most famous A list Hollywood actors, music moguls, our favorite artist and other important people. Whether its in media or movies these crazy parties have been referenced numerous times. We’ve all heard the rumors of the crazy things seen at these parties where in order to enter there are a number of procedures like wearing masks, signing non-disclosure agreements some that even require a blood sample all kinds of crazy stuff. There are even rumors of there being parties within the parties where more sinister things take place. There have been crazy stories of these parties from escorts, cleaners, hotel staff, rappers and regular people who broke their NDA. Remember when WHOA VICKY (an American rapper) told a story about how she was meant to go for a Bella Thorn Halloween party but had to turn it down because the requirements where crazy. The requirements for the party was no phones allowed, an NDA had to be signed, you had to bring your blood sample and bring a ball mask. According to her and I quote (“HELL NO!!!”).  I’m going to talk more about the details of these parties and a first hand experience of a guy who went for one of these parties but before we dive into that I’m going to talk about blackmail.

    <h2>BLACKMAIL </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        What is the most effective way to control someone? let’s thing about this, I believe the answer to this question is blackmail. If you had blackmail on someone who was very important, who had such a strong reputation they would certainly do anything to make sure that secret never sees the light of day. Blackmail goes back to ancient times but the world black mail originated in the 16th century in the border regions of England and Scotland. During this period, settlers paid chieftains for protection from Scottish thieves and marauders or the word Szmalcownik is a pejorative Polish slang expression that originated during the Holocaust in Poland in World War II and refers to a person who blackmailed Jews who were in hiding, or who blackmailed Poles who aided Jews, during the German occupation. By stripping Jews of their financial resources, blackmailers added substantially to the danger that Jews and their rescuers faced and increased their chances of being caught and killed. Blackmail has always been used, most recently with P, Diddy (an American rapper) recording elites and using it for blackmail. Jeffrey Epstein using an Island to blackmail individuals. On this this Island Billionaires come to have inappropriate acts with underage victims, the names that visited this island included, presidents, tech CEO’s, music moguls, politicians, banking officials and anyone who had power or world influence. People often question why they never got caught and I believe the answer to that is because the CIA and private government need those people to exist. Think about it they need those people to gather evidence for them so they too can control those powerful people. I often say the CIA is the largest crime organization on earth, so they probably make a deal. Gather evidence for us and we let you off the hook, then when the heat gets too much on those people they CIA will disassociate from them. You can’t convince me the CIA wasn’t aware of the Epstein Island, it’s just impossible. Also the fact that this island was run for more than 20 years and after it was brought to light not a single person on the list was prosecuted.

    <h2>SELLING YOUR SOUL </h2>  
    <br>
    <p>
           We’ve all heard of the term “selling your soul” but what does this mean, 
          I remember going on YouTube in 2016 and watching illuminati conspiracy theories like “***Top ten celebrities in the Illuminati who sold their souls***”. I always thought that selling  your soul was just signing a contact with blood or something or just signing a bad contact where they screw you over but it seems that it is way darker than anything I could have imagined
          . This term is not new either, the term even mentioned in the bible. "What shall it profit a man" is a phrase from the King James Version of the Bible, Mark 8:36. The verse reads: "For what shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?". This verse is often interpreted as a warning against materialism and the pursuit of wealth at the expense of one's spiritual well-being.  The term first started catching on in the late 1500s, thanks to a man named Johann Faust. Faust was a German Alchemist and magician who was alleged to have made a pact with a demon named Mephistopheles in return for his soul. His talent became famous after being documented in Christopher Mathew’s play, “The tragical history of Dr Faustus.” 100 years later the myth first made it’s way into music, thanks to a classical violinist named Giuseppe Tartini. Legend says the devil came to him in a dream and played the most beautiful piece he had ever heard this piece will later go on to be known as,” the devil’s thrill sonata”(Violin Sonata in G major). When he woke up he tried his best to recreate the piece but to no avail. In his words Tartini wrote, “…it was so inferior to what I had heard, that if I could have subsisted on other means I would have broken my violin and abandoned music forever”. Other characters in musical history have been linked with soul-swapping legends. One individual alleged to have struck a demonic deal was the virtuoso violinist Niccolo Paganini (1782-1840). Reports of Paganini – a gaunt pallid figure who often dressed in black – speak of his flaming eyes and of devils appearing onstage at his concerts. It was claimed he could play on broken strings or play 12 notes a second. During one performance, apparently, the Devil made lightning strike Paganini’s bow. Following Paganini’s death, it took the Church 36 years to allow him burial in consecrated ground which further proved his affiliation with the devil. Another famous soul seller was the American bluesman Robert Johnson (1911-1938), who, according to legend, walked to a Mississippi crossroads with his guitar on his back to meet the Devil at midnight. Standing in the darkness, Johnson played a tune. A finger tapped his shoulder and he handed his guitar to the Evil One, who also gave a brief, and no doubt brilliant, performance. The Devil handed the instrument back and the pact for Johnson’s soul was sealed. Modern musicians, like Led Zeppelin’s, Jimmy Page, Jay Z, Beyonce, Lady gaga, Doja cat have also been accused of participating in diabolical bargains.

    <h2> WHAT WENT ON AT THESE PARTIES?</h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        We have all heard of the sick and twisted things that happen behind the closed doors of these Hollywood parties but we don’t really know what happens. Thanks to private informers and whistle blowers we have an idea. I found a story of a former vine creator from 2015/2016, he was allegedly invited to a Hollywood party and the things he saw at these parties where despicable. This is not my story Im just passing on the message.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
        "You guys remember when all those VINE stars and skit instagramers moved Los Angeles in like 2015 ish, I wasn't a huge creator at the time but I was there and around it all as everything was happening. I moved from Chicago to LA three weeks after high school with like $2000 in my pocket that I saved up working at steak and shake with this other aspiring creator named David. I was much more into editing and being behind the camera at that time and he was much more into vine and vlogs and being on camera that time of our lives was absolutely crazy, everybody was broke posting anything we could onto YouTube to get some attention. I happened to get a spot at the now notorious 1600 vine apartments and David got a spot a little bit closer to USC, everyone was collaborating with everyone and it was the era of clickbait YouTube and to be honest it was extremely fun for first few months until Hollywood started to notice that influencers were the next big thing and that the landscape of the industry was changing. We started to get invited to more exclusive parties and events where it seemed as if old Hollywood was almost grooming new Hollywood and there was rumors of this one gathering that was happening on a monthly basis where it seemed like anybody that got invited saw massive jump in their numbers secured huge brand deals right after attending but apparently this gathering worked on a buddy system someone had to vouch for you and bring you as a guest and by blind luck me and David ended up getting invited. Some talent agents saw me and David shoot a silly skit at a random party he didn't invite us that second he just told us that he saw something special in US and took our contact information. Listen, people do that all the time in LA but this guy had a different feel he wasn’t trying to convince us he had connections or hype himself up like everybody else does he was just super calm and had a sharp way of speaking that demanded respect. He was extremely brief and after getting our numbers he just said lookout for the invite and walked away and this is where it gets weird I never gave this guy my address I only gave him my number but I ended up getting an invitation by letter and at the time I thought that that was so cool but retrospect as an adult looking back at it that alone was a huge violation of privacy and a major red flag but at the time when I tell you, I was absolutely buzzing with excitement. When I got it the letter was so extravagant and detailed it was gold with black and red lettering that read something like "your talents have been noted your name has been endorsed" and I'll never forget this part "the dreams you've been chasing are a night away from the 7th Heaven". 
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        “The address was a beautiful home in Burrell Canyon that was set to happen that weekend, it also noted to not be a minute late and not to expect to leave before midnight and at the time it felt like the Willy Wonka golden Ticket and the excitement doubled when I got a text from David at the same time in all caps saying did you get one too,sssss I felt like our lives were about to change. I was right David blew up after this party and I had to go into hiding, I was so young and naive and delusionally optimistic, I truly believed that I was going to go to this party and leave rich because it literally seemed like that was happening to the creators around me that attended, I was hyped. I've never been a braggy person but when you're young and excited you assumed by good news and want to talk to your friends and peers about so everybody that I chat with who I knew was a content creator and was in the know about this party. All the feedback was positive and along the lines of let me know how it goes or can you try to get me into the next one and even some from bigger creators saying I'll see you there with like a little smirk on their face like they were pumped, except for one. the creator is someone that most of you probably know, this creator is an extremely positive guy and he's one of the most wholesome bubbly genuine guys I met out there and when I told him the good news he looked at me like I told him a tsunami was headed towards the building. The usual joy that this man brought to every conversation turned into real fear and concern and he made me leave the lobby and come up to his apartment before explaining anything to me like he was scared that somebody was going to overhear our conversation. When we got up to his apartment he was just like he had no idea how to start this conversation but when he finally spoke up all he said was listen Doug I know you're excited but I'm begging you please do not go, that man is not who you think he is he was being so frantic and I could see tears welling up in this guy's eyes but I was young and I thought that I knew everything, I didn't even think the talent agent that sent us the invite was important I was interested in the connections and I didn't really care if the talent guy was shady or if his intention was to sign me to a bad deal. I thought I'd just say no to any bad contract that he tried to send but still get to reap all the benefits of the party so I tried to pry a little bit and ask follow up questions but all he gave me was I have a friend who went and he hasn't been the same since he didn't cooperate I don't know what he saw or what they did to him but Doug I do not want to see that happen to you.”

        “Part of me feels like we're dropping ourselves off into a setup but once we arrive all of my worries get washed away. We pull into the driveway and this house is beautiful and extravagant and everyone waiting in line to walk in is smiling and laughing and friendly so I get excited, at the door they take our phones and have a sign an NDA which is common in house parties like this in LA. They give us a mask and a name tag with funny aliases my mask looked like a bear and David looked like a bird my alias was Stardust which David got a crack out of and his was Benji we enter what you could call like the lobby of the house and as we're walking in the apparent host of the party starts giving a speech. This man is very eccentric and outspoken and he's got the cadence of a late night show host and I the agent that invited us standing right behind the speech was basically just encouraging everybody to have fun and explaining the itinerary of the night, apparently this was a themed room party and all of the guests were instructed to move to the next room whenever the grandfather clock chimed. He wrapped up his speech with some cheeky joke and then one line that still irks me to this day he said "have fun now our descent starts at midnight" I try to give David the eyes that I didn't like where this party was going this type of behavior from people that I saw as adults made me extremely uncomfortable, the moment the host wrapped up his speech a couple of workers came out of the door they were holding a couple sets of long poles all of a sudden music started playing and everybody seemed like they knew it was going on so I just went along with it so I guess these parties start off with a big game of limbo it's funny seeing people dress so nicely playing a silly child's game but it's even weirder seeing a list celebrities being so excited to play. Everybody had masks on but when somebody that you grew up watching in movies walks by you with 1/4 of their face covered you still know it's them. I was amazed with how inviting and willing to introduce themselves these people were, I was expecting at least a condescending undertone but it seemed like everybody was involving everybody in conversation and they were frequently introducing themselves to me with their alias of course. The only thing weird about it was something that I didn't notice until the third person did it when they shook my hand they pressed their thumb into the soft part between my thumb and my pointer finger and I only recognized the pattern because the third guy gave me a big smile and said must be your first time here, In retrospect this should have alarmed me but it seemed like they got friendlier when they realized that it was my first time here so I didn't really think anything of it but before I got to ask any follow up questions about this odd handshake the first grandfather clock chime went off and everybody excitedly rushed into the second room.

        “When I finally got in there I was taken aback by the dramatic decor change, everything in this room was different shades of blue the music was romantic and all the furniture was cabana beds and love seats I stood there for a second trying to realize what was different but I could put my finger on it until some girl walked by and caressed my shoulder in a really flirty manner. The decor changed but the way everybody was acting was drastically different before everybody seemed to be outgoing and inviting and friendly but the second they stepped foot into this room they became touchy flirty and suggestive I was only 19 at the time so this type of behavior from people that I saw as adults made me extremely uncomfortable especially when I saw that the cabana beds hand curtains that you could close for privacy and I realized but these people weren't just being suggestive they meant it. I tried to give David the eyes that I didn't like where this party was going but he seemed to be really enjoying the female attention so I was on my own I basically stayed in perpetual motion and walked laps until the next time went off so I didn't have to sit next to anybody for too long and let them get too comfortable. The clock finally went off and everybody rushed to the next room immediately the weirdest or was the people that were in the private sections didn't even bother redressing except for the mask I was in no rush to get to the next room but I could see into it over the crowd of everybody's head the walls were bright orange but the smells that were wafting in from that room were amazing and when I finally got in there it was like the Hogwarts feast it was table after table of the most delicious spreads I've ever seen there was full tables seafood full tables for meats full tables of sushi and an entire wall of spirits I almost started enjoying myself again until I saw the way these people were treating this food they were disrespectfully biting chunks of delicious prime rib roasts, they were just shoving copious amounts of high grade sashimi into their mouths and eating caviar like it was cereal the way that they were grabbing with their hands and just spitting out things that they didn't like onto the floor ruined my appetite at this point I wanted nothing to do with these people.  
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        ”At this point I wanted nothing to do with these people so I went up to the only familiar face in the room the agent that invited me was the only other person not eating, so I approached him and lifted up my mask so he'd recognize me considering we'd only met one time. Before I even got out my greeting or got my mask halfway off my face he abruptly pressed my mask back into place and he said "mask stay on till the 6th room, he did it in a way that seemed like I was embarrassing him for not knowing the rules so to ease the tension I jokingly replied so "we're only halfway there huh" he didn't laugh or make eye contact he just dismissively replied, "I encourage you to engage in the festivities a slow drip is better than a flood" he started to walk towards the door as the clock turned. I didn't like that interaction at all, he's the one that invited you and he seemed to have no interest in talking to me I just kept going over what he said the entire time while we were in the next room. This room was yellow and basically just a casino I wanted to talk to David privately and let him know that I wanted to leave but he seemed to just be caught up in the momentum of the part plus there was a roulette table in the room and David is freakishly good at roulette. So at this point the winning streak that he's building is the center point of the party, I can't fully focus on what the agent said to me because but I have to pretend to be excited about David's winning streak in a fake casino where you're not actually winning money. Like clockwork the chime goes off the entire party starts rushing to the next room and the vibe changes dramatically. I'm the last person to walk into the bright red room this room didn't seem to have a specific activity like the others. It was just empty and bright red and everybody was whispering to each other, for a split second I thought it might be a big game of telephone or something silly like that but as I started walking through it brushing shoulders with these people and hearing what they were saying to each other I started questioning everything. The same people that I saw thing and celebrating and eating together we're whispering the most heinous offensive comments directly to each other I mean things that you wouldn't even say behind your friends back they were saying it to their face I'm talking friendship ending secrets and personal opinions about each other laced with envy and jealousy, I hurried to a quiet corner because I was sick of hearing everybody's dirty laundry after walking after a minute and a half and it all clicked I knew exactly what this party was.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        “I see the host ask the first person in line a question before having them repeat something that he said. When I tell you I am done with this party I'm absolutely not doing that. All the dots start connecting in my head while everybody is being horrible to each other around I'm trying to recap the whole night and remember the order of each room to define my suspicion but the chime for the next room goes off this time everybody gets eerily quiet and calm like they got all of their venom out. The host of the party announces for all of the newcomers to come to the front, all of the attendees form a single file line in front of the next room's door there's about 10 other newcomers in front of me and David and the agent that invited us is standing to the left of the door and the most of the party is standing to the right. The host has a pile of books on the table next to him, I see the host ask the first person in line a question and then grab a book based on his answer. He would present the book to the person and place a diamond shaped metal symbol on top of it before having them repeat something that he said, then he'd take their mask off and let them enter the next room I couldn't make out exactly what he was doing until there was only two people ahead of me in line the books were Bibles, Qurans, Torahs and so on. He would ask the person and which one is yours, whichever they chose he'd grab it and place the metal symbol on top of it he'd have you put your hand on top of the metal symbol and then repeat "I am my own God I bow to nobody but myself something like that. when I tell you I am done with this party. I whip my head around and I tell David I absolutely not doing that, David whispered back in a joking tone like he always does "dude it's just a party who cares I'll see you in the next room" and he skipped me in line to show me that he'd do it first to make me feel more comfortable. He went through with it and giggled his way into the next room it was my turn so I tried to play it cool and whisper to the host do you mind if I skip this part it's making me a little bit uncomfortable, I thought he'd suddenly break character assure me that this is just a party theme and it's all good instead he whispered back to me in a really kind tone "of course man don't worry about it, just take your mask off and turn around" I was relieved for about a split second before the agent that invited me here grabbed my arm and started guiding me towards the exit and I see that everybody that was behind me in line staring at me straight faced. I look back at the host and he's standing up shouts like he's starting a chant ''the price was not paid'' and then everybody in line that was staring at me chance in unison like they knew exactly what to do ''remove the profane and they repeated over and over until I'm through the exit door the price was not paid remove the profane, the price was not paid remove the profane'' so the agent just walks me to the closest door he doesn't even walk me to the front of the party and out the front door he just puts me out into the backyard”.

       "It's 4:00 AM my friend still inside, I don't have my phone so I decide to walk around the right side of the house because that's where all of the party attendees were kind of headed let me see if I could peek in and maybe flag down David to let him know I got kicked out and there's some windows to the next room but of course these windows are like big church stained glass and you can't really see through stained glass windows like the colored ones but if you go really really close and you look through the white parts you could kind of see clearly what is on the inside and this room. it's like a bizarre church replica without all the seating it's just a big church like room and all the people that were in there had their masks off and it was like a big circle and almost looked like an initiation and all of these celebrities are standing around in a circle around the other 9 new people was 10 excluding me. There was big TV grade cameras recording, then there were clearly people in there that were much more serious and kind of threatening and the 10 new people were in the middle of this room being forced to do horrible things, things that I wish I could Unsee and the new people clearly didn't want to do these things they were being forced to do these things. They are clearly recording it and I see my friend being forced to do these horrible things in front of these people and in front of these cameras. I just start panicking I don't know what to do and so in my head I'm like I just need to get out of here, I don't even know as I get to the front of the house one of the employees is standing there and he's standing in front of a car and he has my phone I'm not sure if he knows that I saw everything so I'm kind of standing there during headlights but he just politely goes here's your phone and here's your ride don't worry the driver will take you home so I take my phone and I sit in the car and I'm trying to gauge to see if this driver has any malicious intent but he doesn't seem to and within the first 3 minutes I know that they don't think I saw anything they were just getting my stuff prepared and my car prepared to Take Me Home 'cause they're under the impression that I see anything too bad and I got kicked out before any horrible things started happening to people inside of this party, so I get in the car and I've checked my phone and my phone is fully charged when I got here so I don't know what they did but my phone won't turn on, I have to sit through this 30 minute car ride one of my best friends is back at this party getting mistreated and recorded doing horrible things and I can't tell anybody. I get through this 30 minute horrible suspense filled car ride thinking about all the people that were so nice to me inside of this party and the whole intent of this party was to butter me up to get me to do these horrible things and when I finally get back to my apartment I run upstairs I plug my phone into the charger and the first text that come through are from my friend Joe and I completely forgot that my friend Joe is coming visit me he was coming on a little mini vacation and I was gonna play tour guide and show him around the city so now I'm thinking I only have like 4 1/2 hours to sleep before I have to go pick up my friend from the airport and I still don't know if my other friend is OK, so I'm blowing up David's phone because he's still at this party but I set a timer so I get to the airport to pick up my other friend so I barely get any sleep I drive to LAX to go pick up Joe and I drive that's my apartment and when I'm coming back into my apartment David's in the lobby and he's talking to some other big creators like bouncing video ideas it's like 9/30 10:00 AM at this point so I'm just kind of having coffee by the cafe and chatting I tell Joe to go upstairs to my apartment and drop off his luggage and I go ask David if I could talk to him really quick I'm clearly very distressed and he's being very jokey with me and he doesn't seem like anything that happened and he's just kind of making fun of me for getting kicked out of the party I'm just letting him talk for a little bit and I finally tell him I was looking in through the next window I saw what they made him do and I was just asking him if he's OK and the second I said that he immediately switched on me and he started then you're cussing me out and saying friendship ending things and his eyes turned from happy and giddy to filled with almost you're in a little bit of a trail when he stormed off he pulled out his phone and he was calling somebody as if he was like reporting something back to I immediately start freaking out I assume that he's telling me that I saw what they did and now I have my friend upstairs who thinks he's just on vacation when I just saw hyper success of rich people doing unspeakable acts and they have all the resources to come after they know where I live. Long story short they threatened him and gang stalked him till he ran out of LA.

    <h2>WHAT DOES ALL THIS MEAN? </h2>
    <br>
    <p>
        It’s your choice to believe what this person said or not, but with the amount of detail provided it’s certainly believable. We are going to talk about some of the details provided in the story. Firstly, the masked parties, these masked parties are very common in LA. A lot of these parties require a certain amount of anonymity. The handshake the person talked about is called a masonic handshake, it’s a handshake that freemasons use to identify themselves. If you’re not familiar with what freemasonry is a men’s only fraternal group (cult). There are different variations of the handshake, each handshake represents the degree of freemasonry you belong to. It’s a handshake where you press the soft part between the index finger and thumb. Then we are going to talk about the rooms, those rooms and the activities that took place there are representations of the seven deadly sins. Lust, sloth, gluttony, wrath, envy, greed and pride. When partaking in these activities you are slowly warming yourself up to what is to come at the last room. Just as the talent agent said “a slow drip is better than a flood”, meaning you are slowly breaking your morals so you won’t be overwhelmed at the last door where you basically denounce your religion and do the unspeakable act. I’m sure you’re wondering what the man was doing with those books. Basically, what you are doing is denouncing your faith, so you place your hand on a bible or the religious book you where raised in and say, “Hail to the self, for I am my own master, I am my own God, I need no shepherd for I am no sheep”. This basically is from satanism, saying the lord is not my shepherd for I am no sheep In opposition to the Lord is my shepherd, then after this you enter a room. after you enter this room you go into a cathedral where there are many people in masks, the people in masks are politicians/celebrities/CEO’s/bank executives/rich people. An important detail to take note of is that, There’re cameras everywhere meaning this whole thing is just a giant blackmail ring. Where you do these unspeakable things while being recorded by tv grade cameras. Remember when I said about blackmail being the most effective way to control someone. If you took part in these acts while being recorded, you will do anything you are told to do and push any agenda. Then after doing all this you are then given all these opportunities and you have a lot of influence so your stock is only going to go up. Another important detail is the fact that, they didn’t want to do these things, the person hinted at these acts being pedophilia. After committing such an act no wonder his friend was so paranoid. You guys are probably wondering what they did to him after he got snitched on. Basically, he got a mail with a warning and a picture of him looking through the glass window from security cameras. He was then stalked for example, he would mention there was no milk and the next day milk appears in his fridge or he would lock his doors and the doors would be found unlocked or his turn signal would be turned on and random things like that so if he was to go to police he would be called crazy. Sending a message that they are listening to him and they can do anything to him when they wanted. He just packed his things and drove out of LA. So Hollywood is just a giant blackmail ring CRAZY! I also want to talk about someone else a young lady named Ally Carter. She was a trafficking victim and survivor of satanic ritual abuse, she’s made a lot of claims about a lot of celebrities and some of the twisted things that happened during those parties. She spoke about Diddy parties and the tunnels back in 2020. In 2024 there were tunnels found under Sean Combs 40- million-dollar home during a raid. Lets also not forget about the playboy mansion tunnels.

She said in 2020 she couldn’t bottle it anymore and made a post to Instagram. Ally claims she’d been trafficked as ling as she could remember and had been places like the Buckingham palace, Russia, The Getty museum Los Angeles, tunnels, shipping contains and many more.

She claims she was first trafficked to trap houses, strip clubs then found her way into Hollywood elite parties. Ally has been making headlines recently since the P.DIDDY allegations became public and the tunnels she spoke about in 2020 where found in his 40 million dollar home in 2024. It is also important to note that there is a shipping port right next to Sean Combs million  dollar mansion. We are going to discuss some of her allegations that would make you sick.

    <h2>HER ALLEGATIONS </h3>
    <br>
    <br>
    <h3>TRANSPORTATION </h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        Ally claims she was trafficked from a young age after she ran away from her abusive home. Some of her allegations include the mode in which she was trafficked. Ally claims that there are massive tunnels everywhere in los Angeles. she claims that there are massive tunnels under the Getty museum which was used to transport her and several others. These tunnels lead to schools, grocery stores, celebrity homes you name it. Ally said we should be focused on the elite and everybody thinks that its just these high rank individuals that run things, she claims the garbage man, truck drivers, Teaches, normal day to day people and oddly enough CPS(child protective services) are all in on it and fully aware. She claims these underground tunnels stretch for miles and miles and have strong security so the only way to access them is if you have clearance. She also said, she and several others where transported in shipment containers. Recently some port workers where protesting because they were hearing screaming in shipment containers. Of course mainstream media didn’t cover it only one or two articles where written on it which were quickly taken down. Ally claims there where children in there who didn’t speak English, where sick and from all different parts of the world some of which where on the verge of dying. She claims there where children there ranged from age 6 – 12 and were from all parts of the world.

    <br>
    <h3> THE RITUALS</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        According to Ally down in these tunnels there are shrines used for rituals, these shrines are covered in blood and limbs of human and animal parts. In an interview in 2020 she claimed that those people take part in orgies in these shrines where they have intercourse with dead animals, they make you play with limb. She claims there is blood everywhere, blood who she doesn’t even know who it belongs too. These tunnels have catacombs have dungeons where they take place. She claims she has seen joe Biden, Jay Z, p diddy, comedian’s and some others. According to her “you don’t tell on P.DIDDY”, according to her “There are certain people you don’t talk about because you just don’t, you don’t tell on these people, you are nothing, just an object, just a toy.‘’ according to her “you don’t tell” is a slang among them because nobody is going to believe you. “These people where masks and act possessed, they perform energy harvesting rituals, They are sick.”

    <h3> WHAT WENT ON AT THESE PARTIES?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        Ok so this part gets really dark so I’m just going to quote some of the things she alleged. “DIDDY parties, those are assault parties and I was one of the kids that was one of the party favors and a party favors means that you're set on top of the table and you're used as a toy for anybody who comes across the table or who wants to party at a certain time of night. When the music stops and then the DJ starts these lights and they close the doors and then everybody turns into like a frenzy and starts going into a crazed animal like demonic state and you have no idea what's going on.  Yes there was a time where I was just like completely don't give a **** because it happened and I was the type of kid that thought that you know you're in the presence of Royalty and they make it seem like you're in the presence of Hollywood so you should be you should be honored and you should be appreciating that you're there and I was that person I totally acted like that I was like oh it's fine you know it really doesn't matter but then it really did matter. When my pimp was like he had rules, he had lots of rules and it was more money and if you know the difference between a pimp a John and a trafficker, the trafficker’s supplier but the collecting the money and the John is doing the buying so if the pimp is saying that full house and there's rules to full house sex and there's rules to all kind of different jobs. There are a few celebrities over there it's not just celebrities there's a lot of different people there’s CEO’S, Music executive, comedians, all sorts of people. They call it an all-black party but it was mainly because a lot of the party favors were black kids, I was in the care of Riverside County Child Protective Services at the time I was 15 barely 16, it's foggy a lot happened that night and I weren't really numb and if there's videos or if there's anything that could go from that then pull up because we all know that there's so many cameras around. Nobody's really asking about the kids that are present in these parties now and we're thinking because they're really just going after all the celebrities and the adults which I'm happy that we're finally here and I'm grateful that we're finally pulling the names that need to be pulled in the big fishes that need to be pulled but at the same time nobody's asking about the kids. There's this big *** wheel and they make it like a carnival thing and that they literally strap and they spin with kids on it and after a certain time they have sex with animals and then after a certain time you have no idea what's happening because you're numb and if you throw up like I did then your face is going to be rubbed and you're gonna have to eat it and then people look at that as a sick fetish to blood as a fetish, throw up as a fetish, shit is a fetish so I have DID(disassociate Identity disorder) and I just I wouldn't know after a while there's a reason for all of my splits but I just wouldn't know after a minute and there's times where I didn't, I just checked out, you can you can check out for a few hours while somebody is messing with you.” She also claimed you are transported through tunnels and all the depravity taking place is all being clearly recorded. Ally also claimed she was in auctions, these are human auctions where you are either sat to a table or hung on the wall. I don’t want to even go into details on that because it’s really disturbing. She made references to the Podesta paintings. These paintings where revealed when a journalist was doing a tour off his home. She claimed some of these auctions where not pretty, before these rich individuals purchase you they have to test them like you do in a supermarket. The test included, vaginal stretching, genitalia size, gag reflex, resistance to abuse, resistance to disgust like fecal matter, ejaculate, vomit and others. She claimed after some of these tests where done the children had tears or bled then they would refuse to buy because they are damaged. She also gave other details of the depravity that took place like people who wore strapons and used them on babies till their ribs cracked, Baby farms where they are taken away from their mothers the second they are born and in some cases sold straight out of the womb. This was her reality.

    <h3> HOW DID SHE ESCAPE?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        Ally said when she went to Russia with her pimp she was meant to be sold. She said her pimp lied to her and told her she was going to go back. His real intention was to sell her away, for context she was 16 and they were married. She claimed she had to escape and took a leap of faith, Ally said she doesn’t want to go in to too much detail of how she escaped because it may put the people who helped her at risk. She claimed she had to change how she completely looked and when she finally escaped she went into hiding for a year where she met her now mother who helped her to share her story and change her name to Ally Carter. This is just a summery of how she escaped. Ally started sharing her story in 2021 but only recently started making headlines because the P.DIDDY lawsuit that revealed a lot of the allegations she made back in 2020. Ally has made several police reports with evidence against CPS, she currently doesn’t have a home because she’s constantly on the run for her safety.

    <h3> WHAT I THINK</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
        This is really a lot to take in. I personally believe Ally Carters Accusations because what she has been saying adds up. She has provided so much detail and a lot of it lines up with the recent P.DIDDY lawsuit. I’m not going to sit here and pretend like I would have always believed her. If you told me this a few years ago I would have called you crazy but these days there is so much evidence and so many things have been revealed so it doesn’t seem as insane anymore. To be honest Its still hard to believe but evil things happen in this world and nobody knows what these people do behind closed doors. She mentioned a lot of things but in her Affidavit of truth she mentioned and I quote “At this party there were “body cakes” that kids would lie on a table and people will put food on them and the party goers would eat off the naked kids.” when I saw this it reminded me a lot of spirit cooking parties, I did a whole segment on it. All these allegations are beyond crazy, I didn’t go to deep into details because I don’t feel comfortable typing some vile things. We can only hope these people get justice. There were other claims of victims in Rothschild parties where the guest took part in hunting children. Another victim claimed in those tunnels there were cage fighting clubs for kids, ngl I found that funny until I found out it’s fighting till the death. I hope justice is served and these people end up in hell.
